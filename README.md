# Hackerpass

This repository contains files that make up a hacker's passport,
a fictional passport to collect stamps and sticker from hackerspaces
around the world.

## Hackerpass logo usage consent repo

This repository doubles as collecting consent for using a hackerspace's
logo for a hacker's passport project.

The logo will be incorporated into an updated and extended version of the original
hacker's passport, a CC-by-SA 3.0 project.

The original project is by Mitch Altman and Matthew Borgatti.

## Instructions

Please add a PR for your hackerspace's logo, containing:

- a line in the section below, stating
- the hackerspace's name,
- the hackerspace's website,
- a [X] checkbox mark that you confirm usage of the logo
- a link to the hackerspace's logo, in SVG format in the `images/` directory

By submitting the PR, you guarantee usage of the logo in the project under the
[CC-by-SA 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode.txt).

Please submit a PR **only** if you are authorized by the logo's rights owner to do so!
